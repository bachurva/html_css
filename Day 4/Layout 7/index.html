							<h2>The First Balloon Ascent in England</h2>
								<p>In 1784 the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company made history for the first time, when they were the setting for England’s first balloon ascent, by pioneering Italian aeronaut Vincenzo Lunardi.Despite a flying craze in France and Scotland in the 1780s, the English remained sceptical. So George Biggin and 'Vincent' Lunardi, "The Daredevil Aeronaut", together decided to demonstrate a hydrogen balloon flight at the Artillery Ground of the Honourable Artillery Company in London on 15 September 1784. <br> <br>The balloon was later exhibited at the Pantheon in Oxford Street.However, because the 200,000 strong crowd (which included eminent statesmen and the Prince of Wales) had grown very impatient, the young Italian had to take-off without his friend Biggin, and with a bag that was not completely inflated, but a dog, a cat and a caged pigeon accompanied him.The balloon was later exhibited at the Pantheon in Oxford Street.However, because the 200,000 strong crowd (which included eminent statesmen and the Prince of Wales) had grown very impatient, the young Italian had to take-off without his friend Biggin, and with a bag that was not completely inflated, but a dog, a cat and a caged pigeon accompanied him.The balloon was later exhibited at the Pantheon in Oxford Street.
