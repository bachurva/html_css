					<div class="inlineblock-box width45"><p>Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.</p></div>

					<div class="inlineblock-box width50"><p>What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent? I can set the width of each to 50%, right?</p></div><!--
